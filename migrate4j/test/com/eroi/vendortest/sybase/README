This folder contains a migrate4j.properties file that allows
testing migrate4j against a Sybase database.  Copy this file
into the test directory to make migrate4j use your test Sybase database.

To create a test Sybase database, please complete the following steps:

1)  Open a shell and "cd" to the "test" directory
2)  Source the sa_config.sh or sa_config.csh file
3)  Type:  dbinit testSybase
4)  Type:  dbeng10 -n testSybase -x "tcpip(port=26388)" testSybase.db
5)  In a different shell, type:  dbisql
6)  When Interactive SQL opens, fill in the fields using these values:
		User ID:  DBA
		Password:  sql
		Server Name:  testsybase
		Database Name:  testsybase
7)  In the SQL Statements window, type (or cut and paste):
		create table version (version int not null primary key);
  		insert into version values (0);
8)  Close Interactive SQL and both shells

You only need to do this once.  You will also need to add the Sybase 
driver to your classpath.  

Each time you run the tests, you must first complete the following steps:

1)  Open a shell and "cd" to the "test" directory
2)  Source the sa_config.sh or sa_config.csh file
3)  Type:  dbeng10 -n testSybase -x "tcpip(port=26388)" testSybase.db

This runs your database on port 26388, which will not conflict with a 
Sybase instance running on the default port.

The tests are in com.eroi.sybase.SybaseTest.
