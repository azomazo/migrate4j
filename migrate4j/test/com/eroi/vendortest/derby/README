This folder contains a migrate4j.properties file that allows
testing migrate4j against a Derby database.  Copy this file
into the test directory to make migrate4j use your test Derby database.

To set up your test Derby database, it is assumed that you have
already installed and tested Derby on your system.  If you're not 
able to run ij on your system, please see the Derby docs to get
everything set up.  Once you have Derby running properly,
please complete the following steps:

1)  Open a shell and change to the test directory
2)  Type the following command:    java org.apache.derby.tools.ij
3)  With ij running, type:  connect 'jdbc:derby:testDerby;create=true';
4)  Once the database is created, type: connect 'jdbc:derby:testDerby';
5)  Once connected to the database, create the version table by typing:
		create table version (version int not null primary key);
  		insert into version values (0);
6)  Exit ij

You only need to complete these steps once.  After you have completed
these steps, the tests should run without any additional work.
