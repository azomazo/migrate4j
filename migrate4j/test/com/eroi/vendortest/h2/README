This folder contains a migrate4j.properties file that allows
testing migrate4j against an H2 database.  Copy this file
into the test directory to make migrate4j use your test H2 database.

To set up your test H2 database, please complete the following steps:

1)  Open a shell and change to the test directory
2)  Type the following command:   java -cp ../lib/h2.jar org.h2.tools.Server
3)  Open a browser and go to  http://localhost:8082
4)  Change the "JDBC URL" field to :  jdbc:h2:~/testH2
5)  Press "Connect" button
6)  In the "SQL statement:" text box, type (or cut and paste):
		create table version (version int not null primary key);
  		insert into version values (0);
7)  Hit the "Run" button
8)  Close your browser
9)  Close your shell

You only need to complete these steps once.  After you have completed
these steps, the tests should run without any additional work.
