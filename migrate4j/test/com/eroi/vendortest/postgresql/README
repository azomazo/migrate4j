This folder contains a migrate4j.properties file that allows
testing migrate4j against PostgreSQL. Copy this file
into the test directory to make migrate4j use your test PostgreSQL database.

To set up your test PostgreSQL database, please complete the following steps:

1)  Open a shell
2)  start the PostgreSQL command-line interface:
		$> psql --username=<postgres-admin-user>
3)  Run the following commands:
		postgres=# create role sa login createdb password '';
		postgres=# create database "testPostgreSQL" with owner = sa;
		postgres=# \q
		
Note:  The "$>" represents an shell prompt while "postgres=#" represents
		a psql prompt
		
You only need to complete these steps once.  After you have completed
these steps, the tests should run without any additional work.
