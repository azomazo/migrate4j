This folder contains a migrate4j.properties file that allows
testing migrate4j against a MySQL database.  Copy this file
into the test directory to make migrate4j use your test MySQL database.

To set up your test MySQL database, please complete the following steps:

1)  Open a shell
2)  Log into mysql:
		$>  mysql
3)  Run the following commands:
		mysql>  create database testMysql;
		mysql>  grant all on testMysql.* to sa@localhost;
		mysql>  exit
		
Note:  The "$>" represents an shell prompt while "mysql>" represents
		a mysql prompt
		
You only need to complete these steps once.  After you have completed
these steps, the tests should run without any additional work.
