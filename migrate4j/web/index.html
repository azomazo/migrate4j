<div style="text-align: center;"><h2>Welcome to</h2>
<h1><big>migrate4j</big></h1>

<br>
<br />
<div style="text-align: left;">migrate4j strives to be Java's answer to the db:migrate rake task in
Rails. While it isn't a replacement or clone, it does provide simple
configuration, flexibility and ease of use in a database migration tool.<br>
</div>

<br />
<h3>Basic Concepts</h3>
<div style="text-align: left;">Using migrate4j is as easy as setting up a package and adding classes that
implement the <b>Migration</b> interface.  By
convention, each class is named "Migration_X", with X representing a numerical order for the file to 
be applied in.  For example, you might create the following classes:
<ul>
	<li>Migration_1</li>
	<li>Migration_2</li>
	<li>Migration_3</li>
</ul>
These will be applied, as you might imagine, in the order listed above.  You can apply all of them by
simply calling:
<pre>Engine.migrate()</pre>
Or, apply just Migration_1 with:
<pre>Engine.migrate(1)</pre>
Or, roll all of them back (assuming they've been applied) by simply running:
<pre>Engine.migrate(0)</pre>
